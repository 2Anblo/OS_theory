1. (简答题) Does Peterson’s solution to the mutual exclusion problem shown in Fig. 2-24 work when process scheduling is preemptive? How about when it is non-preemptive?
Yes, Peterson's solution does work in preemptive scheduling.	In my opinion, Peterson's solution might fail when it is scheduled using a non-preemptive method. Let's say, 'turn' is now '1', and interested[0] == true. It will never release the CPU in the while loop and cause a deadlock.


2. (简答题) Measurements of a certain system have shown that the average process runs for a time T before blocking on I/O. A process switch requires a time S, which is effectively wasted (overhead). For round-robin scheduling with quantum Q, give a formula for the CPU efficiency for each of the following:
(a) Q = ∞;(b) Q > T ;(c) S<Q<T; (d) Q = S;(e) Q nearly 0

CPU Efficiency= Total CPU Time/Useful CPU Time
​
(a) Efficiency = T/T = 100%
(b) Efficiency = T/T = 100%
(c) Efficiency =  T/(T+S*T/Q) = 1/(1+S/Q) = Q/Q+S 
	Because Q>S, Efficiency>50%.	Finally, the Efficiency is between 50% and 100%.
(d) Efficiency =  T/(T+S*T/Q) = 1/(1+S/Q) = Q/Q+S = 50%
(e)  Efficiency =  T/(T+S*T/Q) = 1/(1+S/Q) = Q/Q+S nearly 0. 

3. (简答题) Five batch jobs A through E, arrive at a computer center at almost the same time. They have estimated running times of 10, 6, 2, 4, and 8 minutes. Their (externally determined) priorities are 3, 5, 2, 1, and 4, respectively, with 5 being the highest priority. For each of the following scheduling algorithms, determine the mean process turnaround time. Ignore process switching overhead.
(a) Round robin.

(b) Priority scheduling.

(c) First-come, first-served (run in order 10, 6, 2, 4, 8).

(d) Shortest job first.

For (a), assume that the system is multiprogrammed and that each job gets its fair share of the CPU. For (b) through (d) assume that only one job at a time runs, until it finishes. All jobs are completely CPU bound.
(a) Assume that quantum in this case is 1 minute, so that we can switch only once for each job. It has to take 10 rounds in order of A to E.
	In the first round, each job runs for 1 minute.
	Remaining times: A = 9, B = 5, C = 1, D = 3, E = 7
	In the second round, each job runs for 1 minute again.
	Remaining times: A = 8, B = 4, C = 0, D = 2, E = 6
	Job C finishes at time 8.
	In the third round, each job runs for 1 minute.
	Remaining times: A = 7, B = 3, D = 1, E = 5
	Remaining times: A = 6, B = 2, D = 0, E = 4
	Job D finishes at time 17.

	Remaining times: A = 5, B = 1, E = 3
	Remaining times: A = 4, B = 0, E = 2
	Job B finishes at time 23.
	Remaining times: A = 3, E = 1
	Remaining times: A = 2, E = 0
	Job B finishes at time 28.
	Remaining times: A = 1
	Remaining times: A = 0
	Job A finishes at time 30.
	Mean Turnaround Time = 8+17+23+28+30/5 = 21.2min
(b) Priority scheduling.
	B->E->A->C->D
Job B finishes at time 6.
Job E finishes at time 14.
Job A finishes at time 24.
Job C finishes at time 26.
Job D finishes at time 30.
	Mean Turnaround Time = 6+14+24+26+30/5 = 20min

(c) First-come, first-served (run in order 10, 6, 2, 4, 8).
Job A finishes at time 10.
Job B finishes at time 16.
Job C finishes at time 18.
Job D finishes at time 22.
Job E finishes at time 30.
	Mean Turnaround Time = 10+16+18+22+30/5 = 19.2min

(d) Shortest job first.

Job C finishes at time 2.
Job D finishes at time 6.
Job B finishes at time 12.
Job E finishes at time 20.
Job A finishes at time 30.
	Mean Turnaround Time = 2+6+12+20+30/5 = 14min

4. (简答题) A soft real-time system has four periodic events with periods of 50, 100, 200, and 250 msec each. Suppose that the four events require 35, 20, 10, and x msec of CPU time, respectively. What is the largest value of x for which the system is schedulable?

Because 35/50+20/100+10/200+x/250 <= 1, x's maximum value is 12.5.
